  "description": "As a seasoned full-stack web developer, I've embarked on a journey that began in 2020, initially focusing on front-end technologies. Over time, I honed my skills in HTML5, CSS3 (with animations), Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, Redux, and Next.js. In 2023, driven by a desire to broaden my expertise, I ventured into back-end development, embracing Ruby on Rails and Ruby. This transition allowed me to build robust server-side applications, manage databases, and seamlessly integrate APIs.\n Throughout my journey, I've remained committed to clean coding practices, ensuring that every project I undertake delivers optimal performance and scalability. My active participation in open-source projects on GitHub reflects my dedication to collaboration and innovation within the development community. With a passion for both front-end creativity and back-end architecture, I strive to exceed expectations and drive progress in every project I undertake.",
